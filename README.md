AA222FinalProject.py is the Python code for the Optimization Tool

It requires 3 input files:
1) CreditCardDatabase.csv: Provides information about credit cards on the market
2) ExistingCardSetup.csv: User-input for their existing credit cards
3) Spend.csv: User-input for the annual spend for each of the different categories

Optimization Tool generates the optimal card setup based on two point valuations: ThePointsGuy Valuation and Cash valuation and saves them in optimization_results_cash_value.csv and optimization_results_original.csv respectively for the optimal credit card setup for n cards
